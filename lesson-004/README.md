# Lesson 04

In this lesson we learned how to use the javascript operators.

## Contents

### Arithmetic Operators

- 5 + 2 = 7
- 5 - 2 = 3
- 5 * 2 = 10
- 5 / 2 = 2.5
- 5 % 2 = 1
- 5 ** 2 = 25

The arithmetic operators, in javascript, follows the standard precedence of math operators.

### Assignment Operators

- n = 2
- n += 2
- n -= 2
- n *= 2
- n /= 2
- n %= 2
- n %= 2
- n **= 2
- n++
- n--

### Relational Operators

- **>**: greater than;
- **<**: less than;
- **>=**: greater or equal than;
- **<=**: less or equal than;
- **==**: equal to;
- **!=**: different to.

The result of an relational operation is a boolean value.

#### Identity Operator

In javascript exists the identity operator: **===**. This operator tests if the operators are identical.

### Logical Operators

- **!**: negation (not);
- **&&**: conjunction (and);
- **||**: disjunction (or).

### Ternary Operator

In javascript we have a special type of operator: the ternary operator. This operator is identified by **?** and **:** symbols.

#### Structure

`test ? true : false`

## Precedence of Types of Operators

1. Arithmetic;
2. Relational;
3. Negation;
4. Conjunction;
5. Disjunction;
6. Ternary;
7. Assignment.
