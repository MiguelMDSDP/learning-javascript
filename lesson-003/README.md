# Lesson 03

In this lesson we learned how to treat numbers and strings.

## Contents

First, we learned how to store values returned from prompts, using the following commands:

1. **Number.parseInt**(*value*): Transforms the value to an integer.
2. **Number.parseFloat**(*value*): Transforms the value to a float.
3. **Number**(*value*): Tranforms the value to the type of the number passed as argument.

After that, we learned how to parse values to string:

1. **String**(*value*)
2. *value*.**toString**()

We also worked with templates strings using the ` signal to delimit strings and the ${value} operand to use variables as string.

Finally, we learned some functions to treat strings and numbers:

1. *value*.**length**: return the length of the string *value*.
2. *value*.**toUpperCase**(): sets all letters of the string *value* to upper case.
3. *value*.**toLowerCase**(): sets all letters of the string *value* to lower case.
4. *value*.**toFixed**(*numberOfDecimalCases).**replace**("*whatIsGoingToBeReplaced*", "*Replacement*")
5. *value*.**toLocaleString**('*location*', {*style*})

And the *document*.**write**(*value*) command.
